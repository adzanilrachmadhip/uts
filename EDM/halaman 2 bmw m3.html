        <h4>Engine</h4>
            <p3>The BMW M3 is usually powered by a very powerful twin-turbocharged inline-6 <br>
                engine with a displacement of around 3.0 liters. These engines produce <br>
                impressive power, often exceeding 400 horsepower, and huge torque, providing <br>
                very fast acceleration and high performance. These engines are paired with <br>
                sophisticated automatic or manual transmissions, and are often equipped with <br>
                rear-wheel drive or all-wheel drive (AWD) systems for exceptional handling in a <br>
                variety of road conditions. As such, the BMW M3 is one of the most acclaimed <br>
                high-performance sedans in the world.</p3>
